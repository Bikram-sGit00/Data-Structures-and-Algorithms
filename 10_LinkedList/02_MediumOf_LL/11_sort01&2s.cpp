✅ Brute Force -->  will set 3 counters for 0s, 1s and 2s and then will traverse the linked list and count the number of 0s, 1s and 2s. After that we will again traverse the linked list and update the values of nodes according to the count of 0s, 1s and 2s.

// Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N) = O(2N) ~ O(N)
// Space Complexity: O(1)
